### Built with

- NUXT
- BootStrap
- Vuetify
- Semantic HTML Markup
- CSS3
- AOS

### What I learned

As a process of documenting progress, i include this sectiion in my projects. I learned proper use of javascript built in api's as well as managing and utilizing the nuxt store and built in functionality.

### Continued development

The project is made to be responsive on all viewport but one thing that i desire more in my project is bringing more life and user engagement to each section and the whole project as whole. To accomplish this, i would be venturing more into calling css styles using an intersection observer and also mastering the public library ![AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). Then Three.js would be my next journery.
