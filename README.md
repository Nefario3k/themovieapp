## Built with

- AOS

## What I learned

As a process of documenting progress, i include this sectiion in my projects. I learned proper use of javascript built in api's as well as managing and utilizing the nuxt store and built in functionality.

## Continued development

The project is made to be responsive on all viewport but one thing that i desire more in my project is bringing more life and user engagement to each section and the whole project as whole. To accomplish this, i would be venturing more into calling css styles using an intersection observer and also mastering the public library ![AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). Then Three.js would be my next journery.

## Useful resources

- [Vuetify - Material Framework](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) - This helped me with easy and useful UI component, styles and animation and tons of amazing funtionalities.

- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) - This (if your not familar with), is a javascript framework built on another javascript frameworks and helps build amazing websites and webapps a lot faster than using raw javascript.

- [Tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org) - This app was built using public api's prepared and designed by The Movie DB (TMDB). Create an account and get an api key allowing one to go through their easy to read and understand documentation.
